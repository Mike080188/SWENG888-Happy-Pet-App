THE HAPPY PET APPLICATION

Project Description

The Happy Pet Application is an acedemic Android group project. The Happy Pet application focuses on exposing users to the wide variety of pet products
available at small pet stores while also providing directions to these pet store locations. The app is meant as a proof of concept and not intended for production use.

Mission Statement

The Happy Pet application provides a platform for pet owners to browse for highly
recommended products and find small pet stores with ease and efficiency.


Target Audience

The Happy Pet application is targeted to pet parents that want to support small pet stores as
well as providing exposure to small businesses. Large pet store corporations have the funding
to attract their customers while smaller stores may not have such resources. With this
application, conscious pet parents can support growing businesses that offer a wider variety of
healthy pet food options compared to large pet stores.
